## Security Tips

### How can I avoid scams?

**Red Flags**:
- 🚨 Promises of guaranteed returns
- 🚨 Pressure to invest quickly
- 🚨 Unverified contracts
- 🚨 Anonymous teams
- 🚨 No audit or whitepaper
- 🚨 Unrealistic tokenomics
- 🚨 Copy-pasted projects

**Always**:
- ✅ DYOR (Do Your Own Research)
- ✅ Check multiple sources
- ✅ Verify team identity
- ✅ Read audit reports
- ✅ Start with small amounts
- ✅ Trust your instincts

### What is a honeypot?

**Honeypot scam**:
- You can BUY the token
- You CANNOT SELL the token
- Contract prevents selling
- You lose all money invested

**How to detect**:
- Use token scanner before buying
- Check for "honeypot" flag
- Test with small amount first
- Look for sell transaction history

### What are hidden taxes?

**Hidden tax scam**:
- Contract takes more than claimed
- High buy/sell fees (>10%)
- Variable taxes that change
- Taxes sent to owner wallet

**Protection**:
- Scan token before buying
- Check tax percentages
- Verify tax distribution
- Look for tax change functions

### Should I trust "audit passed" claims?

**Verify claims**:
- Find actual audit report
- Check auditor reputation
- Read the findings
- See if issues were fixed
- Confirm audit date vs deployment

**Red flags**:
- No link to actual report
- Unknown auditor
- Audit older than contract
- Critical issues unfixed
- Fake audit badges

### What is rug pull?

**Rug pull**: Developer steals liquidity or investor funds

**Types**:
1. **Liquidity rug**: Remove liquidity pool
2. **Mint rug**: Mint massive tokens and sell
3. **Code rug**: Malicious function activated

**Protection**:
- Check liquidity lock status
- Verify ownership renounced
- Read audit report
- Review tokenomics
- Research team reputation

### How can I protect my wallet?

**Best Practices**:
1. Use hardware wallet for large amounts
2. Never share seed phrase
3. Verify website URLs (phishing!)
4. Revoke unlimited approvals regularly
5. Use separate wallet for testing
6. Enable 2FA everywhere possible
7. Keep software updated

**Useful Tools**:
- Revoke.cash (check approvals)
